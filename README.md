How to set it up (Do this once):
Because your screen size is different than mine, you have to teach the app where the buttons are.

​Open FS Golf on your screen.

​Open this app.

​Right-Click the "Chip" button. It will count down 5 seconds. Hover your mouse over the chipping button in FS Golf until it saves.
It will do this twice. Once for X coordinates and once for Y Coordinates.

​Right-Click the "Full" button and do the same thing for the Full Swing mode.
It will do this twice. Once for X coordinates and once for Y Coordinates.

This only has to be done once. if somethinf changes just follow steps above to redo.

​How to use it:
Just click "Chip" or "Full" on the overlay whenever you need to switch.
